Welcome to my public repository that I created spesially for them who's
interested me as a potential employee.

Here I'll collect my public projects thats characterize my current skills
in programming. Nowadays are Python, Django, HTML5, CSS, a bit of JavaScript
and SQL with MySQL.

My English is B1 now and I improve it by learning of grammar on YouTube and
practice of speaking with real people using a Govar application.

I'm currently working on project Todo-List where I'm using Vue.js - that's a
new expirience for me so wish me good luck! =)
